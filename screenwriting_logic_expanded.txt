SCREENWRITING SOFTWARE SPECIFICATION – HYPER-DETAILED BUSINESS LOGIC (ULTIMATE ZERO-EFFORT USER-FRIENDLY VERSION)
This document explodes the previous extreme user-friendly business logic into an unprecedented depth of automation, empathy-driven predictions, effortless creativity boosters, and soul-soothing forgiveness mechanisms. The philosophy evolves: The system isn't just a tool—it's an invisible writing soulmate that reads your mind, heals your typos before they sting, amplifies your spark without stealing it, and turns every keystroke into a symphony of professional elegance. Users feel profoundly seen, never judged; writing becomes a joyful trance where ideas flow pure and the format is a forgotten dream. Every rule is layered with micro-delights, adaptive learning from the first word, and safeguards that make imperfection impossible yet creativity boundless. We've tripled the granularity: More detections, more predictions, more edge-case embraces, all while keeping the surface as simple as breathing.


GLOBAL PRINCIPLES (EXPANDED TO CORE USER EMPOWERMENT)



Absolute zero-thought formatting: The system owns every pixel of polish—capitalization, spacing, indents, breaks—while the user's voice reigns supreme. No decisions, no distractions.
Screenplay standards (Celtx/Final Draft hybrids, user-customizable) activate invisibly: Instant, adaptive, and evolving with the user's subconscious style.
Ultimate goal: Scribble like a fever dream in a notebook; emerge with an Oscar-contender script. Effortless entry, infinite depth.
Hyper-contextual omniscience: Predicts not just words, but emotions, plot rhythms, and user fatigue—offering whispers of inspiration or gentle rests.
Radical forgiveness: Every "mistake" is reframed as genius-in-progress; the system elevates, never erases, with reversible magic.
Delight ecosystem: Micro-rewards (e.g., a firefly sparkle on a killer line) build dopamine loops; accessibility baked in (voice-to-text, dyslexia-friendly fonts).
Ethical core: Privacy fortress (local-first processing); inclusivity (multi-language auto-detect, neurodiverse pacing aids).
Scalability soul: From haiku-short scenes to epic sagas, it breathes with the story's pulse.



AUTO-FORMATTING RULES (OMNI-PREDICTIVE SYNERGY ENGINE)


2.1 INTENT DETECTION (ULTRA-GRANULAR)
System employs a neural-like web of cues for pinpoint accuracy:

Linguistic layers: Syntax (e.g., imperative = action; quoted = dialogue), semantics (e.g., "whispers" = parenthetical), pragmatics (e.g., question after statement = response).
Temporal patterns: Typing velocity (frenetic = action burst; deliberate = heading); pauses (post-name hesitation = dialogue incoming).
Historical context: Preceding block (action → likely character; dialogue → next speaker); global story (recurring motif like "rain" → atmospheric cue).
Multimodal hints: If voice input, tone analysis (excited = caps emphasis; somber = italics).
New expansions:
Emotional undercurrents: Sentiment shift (e.g., joy to rage) → auto-insert beat like "(eyes narrow)".
Prop interactions: "John grabs lamp" → auto-SFX "LAMP CLATTERS" if dynamic.
Narrative devices: "meanwhile" → parallel scene block; "cut back" → return transition.
Inclusivity detects: Diverse names/locations auto-sensitized (e.g., cultural spellings preserved).
Meta-intents: "todo: fix this" → tags as collapsible note, not formatted text.

2.2 AUTO-CAPITALIZATION (PRECISION FORGIVENESS LAYER)

Scene slugs: "int basement day" → "INT. BASEMENT - DAY" (auto-period, em-dash, time inference like "dusk" if prior night).
Characters: Partial name (e.g., "jo") → full "JOHN" if matched; new intros auto-capped with optional descriptor glow (e.g., "JOHN, 40s, weary").
Transitions/Shots: "faDE in" → "FADE IN:"; "wIde shot" → "WIDE SHOT:" with auto-colon.
Debut elements: First prop/location/beat → subtle cap + footnote (e.g., "THE GUN introduced here").
Dialogue dynamics: Standalone "i think" → "I think"; emphatic clusters (e.g., "yes yes yes") → staggered caps "YES! YES! YES!".
Genre infusions: Sci-fi acronyms (e.g., "ai") → "AI"; period pieces (e.g., inferred 1800s) → formal caps.
User quirks: Chronic lowercase? System mirrors in previews but polishes output; toggle via "casual me" whisper.
Revert rapture: Caps glow for 3s—tap to uncap, teaching without scolding.

2.3 AUTO-INDENTING & POSITIONING (FLUID GEOMETRY)
Zero-effort spatial magic:

Characters: Centered at 3.7" with aura padding; multi-syllable names auto-hyphen if wrapping.
Dialogue: 2.5" nest, fluid wrap (no orphans), line-height breathes with length.
Parentheticals: +0.5" indent, 10% smaller font, italic lean for intimacy.
Transitions: 6" right-flush, italic underline for poetry (e.g., "DISSOLVE TO:").
Headings: Left-bold, 1.5x spacing above for scene breath.
Dual/Trio: Auto-columns (left/right/center), sync-heights; interruptions → overlapping indents.
Action: Full-bleed, auto-para every 4-6 lines for scannability, hyphenation only on exports.
New:
Montage/Montage elements: Nested 0.25" indents, auto-numbered (1/5), fade-to-next visuals.
Flashback nests: Subtle 0.1" inset, timestamp overlay (e.g., "1995" badge).
Prop blocks: Slight right-lean for inserts (e.g., "LETTER reads:").
Accessibility: High-contrast edges on indents; voice readout skips formatting fluff.

2.4 AUTO-CENTERING (EMOTIONAL HIGHLIGHTER)
Centers for maximum impact, only where it sings:

Titles/Acts: "ACT TWO" → grand center, font swell.
Forced elements: "FADE IN:", "THE END" → theatrical centering with vignette fade.
User specials: Keyword "centerline" → one-off magic; recurring? Auto-profile.
Never headings: Keeps momentum left-flow; exception: Epic poems in fantasy genre.
Adaptive: Screen size scales center (mobile = tighter); emotional peak (climax line) → temporary center pulse.

2.5 AUTO-PARENTHETICALS (EMPATHIC WHISPERS)

"(" trigger: Auto-closes ")", indents, suggests common (e.g., "(beat)" after pause).
Post-name cues: "Sarah smirks" → "SARAH (smirking)"; multi-word → natural flow.
Overflow handling: >15 words → auto-suggest "(cont.)" split or poetic wrap.
Tags expansion: "os john" → "JOHN (O.S.)"; "filter" → "(filtered, dreamlike)".
Emotional AI: Context-infused (e.g., after "cries" → "(choking back sobs)").
Undo intimacy: Parenthetical shimmers—swipe to expand/collapse inline.
Genre flavors: Comedy → winky "(sarcastic)"; horror → "(whispered terror)".

2.6 AUTO-DIALOGUE MODE (CONVERSATIONAL CRADLE)

Character-follow: Instant dialogue indent, grammar softens (fragments OK, e.g., "Yeah. No. Wait.").
Interrupts: Mid-line Enter → "--" em-dash; resume predicts overlap.
Trailing magic: Ellipsis → ghost "..." with "continue?" nudge; unresolved? Auto-flags for later.
Ensemble flow: "Group laughs" → stacked shorties under "CROWD"; rotates speakers.
Voice harmony: Input tone → punctuation vibe (e.g., rising inflection → "?").

Rhythm aid: Long speech? Subtle "breath?" pause suggestion.

2.7 AUTO-(CONT'D) & CONTINUATION LOGIC (SEAMLESS THREADS)

Gap detection: Action interrupt → "(CONT'D)" auto, with curly quote.

Cultural smarts: Regional spellings (e.g., "colour" UK-preserved).
Learning loop: User overrides → "noted, your way now"; 80% adoption threshold.
Bliss revert: 5s glow on fixes—tap for "keep raw" or "polish more".

2.9 AUTO-SFX & ATMOSPHERE (SENSORY SYMPHONY)

Onomatopoeia: "boom" → "BOOM!" upper-italic; context amps (e.g., "heart boom" → subtle pulse).
Ambient weaves: "Wind howls" in EXT. NIGHT → italic "WIND HOWLS OUTSIDE".
Repetition remix: Echo SFX → vary (CRASH! ... crash).
Multi-sense: "Sizzle" + food context → "SIZZLE OF BACON".
