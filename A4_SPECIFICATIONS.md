## Professional Formatting Rules

### Case Enforcement
```
UPPERCASE Elements:
  ✓ Scene Headings (INT. OFFICE - DAY)
  ✓ Character Names (JOHN)
  ✓ Transitions (CUT TO:, DISSOLVE TO:)
  ✓ Special codes ((V.O.), (O.S.), (CONT'D))

Lowercase Elements:
  ✓ Parentheticals (except special codes)
  ✓ Examples: (beat), (looking back), (whispers)

Mixed Case (Normal):
  ✓ Action descriptions
  ✓ Dialogue text
  ✓ Scene location text
```

### Spacing Rules
```
Between Elements (Screenplay):
  Scene Heading → [blank line] → Action
  Action → [blank line] → Character Name
  Character Name → [NO blank line] → Parenthetical (optional)
  Parenthetical → [NO blank line] → Dialogue
  Dialogue → [blank line] → Character/Action/Transition
  Transition → [blank line] → Scene Heading

No Double-Spacing:
  ✗ Never double-space dialogue blocks
  ✗ Never double-space within action paragraphs
  ✓ Single-space all text within elements

Blank Line Purposes:
  • Separates major elements
  • Aids readability
  • Professional appearance
  • Maintains ~55 lines per page standard
```

### Indentation Specifications (In Characters)
```
Courier 12pt, 10 characters per inch:

LEFT MARGINS:                RIGHT MARGINS:
Action:        15 chars      1"
Character:     ~37 chars     Variable (centered)
Dialogue:      25 chars      10 chars
Parenthetical: 31 chars      Variable
Scene Heading: 15 chars      1"
Transition:    50+ chars     1" (right-aligned)

Conversion to inches:
  15 chars ÷ 10 = 1.5"
  25 chars ÷ 10 = 2.5"
  37 chars ÷ 10 = 3.7"
  50 chars ÷ 10 = 5.0"
```

## Implementation in ScriptWriter Pro

### PageFormatting Class Implementation
```csharp
public class PageFormatting
{
    // Letter dimensions
    public PageSize Size = PageSize.Letter;  // or PageSize.A4
    
    // Margins (in inches)
    public double MarginLeft = 1.5;          // Binding margin
    public double MarginRight = 1.0;
    public double MarginTop = 1.0;
    public double MarginBottom = 1.0;
    
    // Typography
    public string FontFamily = "Courier New";
    public int FontSizePoints = 12;
    
    // Screenplay standard
    public int LinesPerPage = 55;  // Ensures 1 page ≈ 1 minute
    
    // Calculated properties
    public double GetContentWidth()
    {
        double pageWidth = (Size == PageSize.A4) ? 8.27 : 8.5;
        return pageWidth - MarginLeft - MarginRight;
        // Result: 5.27" (A4) or 5.77" (Letter)
    }
}
```

### Pagination Calculation
```csharp
public int GetTotalPageCount(string scriptText)
{
    int lineCount = scriptText.Split('\n').Length;
    int pageCount = (lineCount + 55 - 1) / 55;  // Round up division
    return Math.Max(1, pageCount);
}

public double GetEstimatedScreenMinutes(string scriptText)
{
    int pageCount = GetTotalPageCount(scriptText);
    return pageCount * 1.0;  // 1 page = 1 minute
}
```

### Formatting Rules Application
```csharp
string scene = FormatSceneHeading("int. office");
// Result: "INT. OFFICE - DAY" (if time not provided)

string character = FormatCharacter("john (v.o.)");
// Result: "JOHN" (extensions removed, uppercase)

string paren = FormatParenthetical("Looking back");
// Result: "(looking back)" (lowercase, added parens)

string transition = FormatTransition("cut");
// Result: "CUT TO:" (uppercase, proper format)
```

## Testing & Validation

### Sample Screenplay (for testing)
```
FADE IN:

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - MORNING

Modern glass and steel. Busy morning traffic. JOHN (32, sharp
suit, tired eyes) enters, coffee in hand.

He approaches the elevator.

                      ELEVATOR OPERATOR
              "Good morning, sir."
              
                      JOHN
              "Morning."

He enters the elevator.

                          CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE - JOHN'S DESK - CONTINUOUS

John sits down at his desk. His computer is already on, dozens
of emails waiting. He takes a sip of coffee, grimaces.

His phone BUZZES. A text message appears:

PHONE TEXT
"Call me when you get a chance. -Sarah"

John stares at the message.

                      JOHN
                      (to himself)
              "She finally texted back."

He hesitates, then puts the phone down. Back to work.

                          FADE OUT.

                          THE END
```
